## Original Work

## Extensions and Enhancements

The enhancements to the original library include:

- Support for all ImgProxy features including Pro functionality
- URL encryption support
- Enhanced URL building options
- Support for the info endpoint
- Support for chained pipelines
- Comprehensive implementation of all ImgProxy processing options
